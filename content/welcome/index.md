# Local Proportional Representation
### Regionally Proportional.<br>Locally Representative.

<hr>

### Why Local PR?
Local Proportional Representation (Local PR) would transform our antiquated "first past the post" electoral system, as promised by our Prime Minister. We want diverse voices representing Canadians in our democratic system, to be truly reflective of the diversity of our citizens and ideas. 

We believe Canada's electoral system should:

* Better represent the diversity in our country through proportional representation
* Have representation by a MP from their own riding
* Be simple
* Avoid the need for strategic voting

Local Proportional Representation (Local PR) does all this and more.  It aims to be an
alternative to "First-Past-the-Post" that we can all agree on so that we finally
"make every vote count", as Mr. Trudeau promised during the last election.

Find out more about the network of local groups, each petitioning their local MPs
to bring Local PR to Parliament, at [AllVotesCount.ca](http://AllVotesCount.ca).

### What is Local PR?

Local Proportional Representation takes an important part of our current voting 
system -- having a representative from every riding in the country -- and adds 
proportional representation. It is regionally proportional and locally representative.

Neighbouring ridings are grouped into regions of 4-7 ridings. Voters can rank the 
candidates from across their region or just in their home riding.  They can vote by 
party or for the individual candidates most closely aligned with their own values.

Votes are counted as in leadership contests: by dropping the least popular candidate
until enough people are elected.  Voters' 2nd and later preferences are used when
appropriate.  The result is reasonably proportional across the region and quite
proportional across the country.
