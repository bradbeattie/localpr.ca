# Welcome

Welcome to *LPR for [Electoral] Geeks*, a companion to 
[AllVotesCount.ca](http://allvotescount.ca).  AllVotesCount is the
gentle introduction to Local Proportional Representation.  This site
is for those die-hards that want to know *all* about how LPR works.

This web site is maintained by [Byron Weber Becker](mailto:info@lpr-for-geeks.ca), the primary
author of Local Proportional Represenation.
