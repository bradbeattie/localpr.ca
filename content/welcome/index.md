# Welcome

Welcome to [LocalPR.ca](https://localpr.ca), a companion to 
[AllVotesCount.ca](http://allvotescount.ca).  AllVotesCount is the
gentle introduction to Local Proportional Representation.  This site
is for those who want to know *all* about how LPR works.

This web site is maintained by [Byron Weber Becker](mailto:info@localpr.ca), the primary
author of Local Proportional Represenation.
