[LocalPR.ca](http://localpr.ca) is a companion to 
[AllVotesCount.ca](http://allvotescount.ca).  AllVotesCount is the
gentle introduction to Local Proportional Representation and the campaign
to getting it adopted.  This site
is for those who want to know *all* about how Local PR works.

This web site is maintained by [Byron Weber Becker](mailto:info@localpr.ca), the primary
author of Local Proportional Representation.
