1.	It seems undemocratic for voters in other ridings to vote for my MP.

	Local PR has a different mind-set than First-Past-The-Post.  In FPTP the voters in the riding select
	the MP.  In Local PR the voters in the region select the MPs for the region as a whole.  The guarantee
	of one MP in each riding is not to say that each riding gets their choice but that each riding 
	has representation on really local issues and someone local to help constituents.


1. My riding elected an NDP candidate but surrounding ridings all went Conservative.  Will we keep our 
	NDP MP if these ridings form a region?

	Short answer:  yes

	Longer answer:  Let's make the question a bit more interesting -- "We *almost* elected an NDP MP in our
	riding but got trounced by Conservatives in neighbouring ridings.  If these ridings are grouped into
	a region, what happens?"

	Let's make some assumptions:  there are four ridings, each with 100<sup>1</sup> possible voters.  First choice votes
	were as follows:

	<table class="numbers">
		<thead>
		<tr><th>Party</th><th>Riding A</th><th>Riding B</th><th>Riding C</th><th>Riding D</th></tr>
	</thead>
		<tr><td>Con</td><td>40</td><td>60</td><td>55</td><td>55</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Lib</td><td>25</td><td>25</td><td>25</td><td>21</td></tr>
		<tr><td>NDP</td><td>35</td><td>15</td><td>20</td><td>24</td></tr>
	</table>

	[Quota](/details/quota), the number of votes that guarantees the election of a candidate, is 1/5*v + 1 or 1/5*400 + 1 or 81 votes.  

	Finally, let's assume that second choice votes for NDP voters go to Riding A.

	The NDP candidates in Riding B and C are dropped first and transfer to A, giving a total of 35 + 15 + 20 = 70.
	The Liberal in Riding D drops next.  Assume they also transfer to Riding A, but 46 is not enough for the Liberal there
	to win.  

	When the NDP candidate in Riding D is dropped and those votes transfer
	to Riding A giving more than 81 votes and that NDP candidate will be elected.

1. Can an urban riding with lots of voters swamp the vote of rural riding in the same region?
	
	This question has a faulty premise:  that urban ridings have more voters than rural ridings.  
	It does happen, but it's rare.  Part of the 
	[mandate](http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&dir=cir/red/faq&document=index&lang=e#faq11) 
	of the current Electoral Boundaries Commissions is to make sure that ridings are all 
	approximately the same size as the average riding within the province.  Without a large 
	difference in population, it's hard to see how one riding could manipulate the outcome in 
	another without hurting themselves.
