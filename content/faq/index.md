# Frequently Asked Questions


If you don't find it here or you think you have a better answer, 
please contact [Byron Weber Becker](info@lpr-for-geeks.ca).

<!--
## Notes

### Fairness
Is the same method used in rural and urban areas?

What would happen in a 5 member district in NW Calgary where one Party normally gets 50%-60% of the vote? Would we still get 5 from the same Party?

What happens if one rural riding gets put into a region with several urban ridings?  Would their concerns still be represented?

### General
Does this method leave "safe seats" ? Same person same seat?

How does this produce a proportional result?

How is this different than STV (Single Transferable Vote)?

How is this different than RUPR (Rural-Urban Proportional Representation)?

Is one, say Liberal, competing against all other Liberals in the five ridings or he or she only competing against the other party candidates in that one riding?

### Regions
How are the regions created?

### Counting
How long will it take to count the vote?

Once someone is elected in a given riding are all other candidates from that riding are eliminated?


### LPR+
Would the top-up seats be assigned to the region as a whole not the single member ridings?
