Local Proportional Represenation (Local PR):

- Groups 4-7 existing ridings into a region
- The region as a whole elects MPs to represent them
- Local PR guarantees that each riding will have its own MP

If the first two bullets sounds like Single Transferrable Vote (STV),
that's because they are!  The contribution of Local PR is the guarantee that
each riding within the region will have a local MP.

Local PR, as described above, delivers pretty good proportionality (Gallagher
Index < 5 on a wide variety of inputs).  However, to make the proportionality
even better, we envision adding a small number of compensatory ("top-up")
MPs at a later date.
