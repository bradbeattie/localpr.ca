Local PR groups 4-7 ridings into a region.  Voters within the region rank candidates
on a ballot similar to the following.  The voter's own riding is highlighted.  A voter
can rank as few (just 1!) or as many candidates as they want.

Counting is like many leadership races:  the ballots are placed in piles according 
to the first preference vote (this one goes on the pile for Gord Miller).  The
candidate with the smallest pile is dropped and those ballots redistributed to 
the next prefered candidate.  Eventually a candidate will have enough votes to 
win a seat.  That person is declared a winner and any surplus votes are fairly distributed
to next preferences.  This continues until all of the seats are filled.

The guarantee of one MP to represent each riding is achieved by "protecting" the
last candidate in each riding from being dropped.
