Local Proportional Representation is a consensus model.  It aims to 
simultaneously satisfy many objections to proportional representation.
We want Local PR to be the model that everyone can agree on, even though
it may not be anyone's favourite.

In listening to the debate so far -- including town hall meetings, letters
to the editor, concerns from MPs, reaction to previous proposals, members
of the ERRE, etc. --
we heard the following ten concerns that an electoral system should satisfy.

### 1. Local Representation
Canadians are used to having a local MP that knows the local issues
and that constituents can depend on to help address their problems.  Most 
are not willing to give this up.

Constituents, MPs, and members of
local riding associations, particularly in ridings that are already large,
are all concerned that ridings do not increase in size.

Local PR maintains existing riding boundaries and guarantees a the election
of a local-nominated MP within each riding.

*A valuable side effect is that Local PR can be implemented easily with little 
disruption.*

### 2. Proportionality
Many Canadians see a fundamental problem with FPTP which can give 100% of 
the power to a party receiving less than 40% of the vote.  The preferred 
way to address this is with a proportional electoral system.

Local PR is proportional.  Its Gallagher Index of Disproportionality is less than 5
for almost all simulated scenarios.  The ERRE report called for systems with
a Gallagher Index of less than 5.
Adding a very modest number of compensatory ("top-up") seats similar to 
Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) at a later date can increase the proportionality
even further.

### 3. Sincere voting
Canadian voters are tired of voting strategically.  They say over and over
that they would like to vote *for* a candidate rather than against one 
they fear.  Furthermore, voters want to know that if they support a candidate
who may not win that their vote won't be wasted.

Local PR uses a ranked or preferential ballot.  Voters rank as many or as few
candidates as they wish, in order, starting with 1.  Votes that can't help
elect a preferred candidate are fairly transferred to other candidates to
help them.

### 4. Accountability
Canadians believe that MPs should be accountable to voters rather than party
bosses.  Voters should be able to replace a poorly performing MP in the next
election.

Under Local PR every MP must face the voters directly and win the support of an
appropriate number of voters (based on the number of MPs being elected in the 
region).

### 5. Collaborative governments
MyDemocracy.ca, the government's effort to educate people about electoral
reform, asked about cross-party cooperation six different ways. In each one
a strong majority of Canadians indicated they wanted better collaboration,
even if it slowed decisions down.

More collaborative governance is a feature of many proportional systems, 
including Local PR.  There are at least two effects at play.  First, the 
ranked or preferential ballot which encourages candidates to treat their
fellow candidates well to attract 2nd and 3rd choices.  Second, most
governments formed proportionally are coalitions that need to work across
party lines to advance their agenda.  Coalitions are the norm in most
democracies.


### 6. Diverse parliamentarians
Canadians are a diverse group and want to see that diversity reflected in
their leaders.  People want to see a reflection of themselves when they 
look at their parliamentatians.

Local PR, like other proportional systems, tends to elect a more diverse set of people because 
voters in a given region elect more than just one person.  

### 7. Manageable number of parties
People like having a choice of parties, but recognize that too many parties can
be counter-productive.  The multi-member nature of Local PR requires a candidate 
to earn a significant number of votes before being elected.  This forms a natural 
barrier to niche, special-interest parties.

### 8. Simplicity in the voting process
Opponents of proportional representation claim the voting process can be too difficult.

Local PR's flexible ballot allows the voter to make it as simple as FPTP.  With a modest
amount of additional effort, a voter can rank their ballot to avoid a wasted vote and
to increase proportionality.

### 9. No additional MPs
Many Canadians believe that we already have enough politicians and should not enlarge
the House of Commons.

Local PR does not add MPs.  When our usual processes redraw boundaries or add MPs after the
next census, Local PR+ could be used to increase proportionality.

### 10. Protect against political extremists
In light of recent experience in Europe and elsewhere, many Canadians are concerned 
that “fringe parties” might acquire undue amounts of power under a proportional system.
However, for "fringe parties" to form government in a proportional system, they 
would need to either win 50% of the vote or work together with other parties who presumably would not accept the fringe parts of their platform anyway. The dangers of a fringe minority taking power are actually higher under first-past-the-post where one party can take power with as little as 35% of the popular vote. Like all proportional systems, Local PR rewards each party according to its share of the vote.
