Local Proporitional Representation (Local PR) is an electoral system designed
specifically for Canada.  

* Local PR is proportional.
* Local PR does not enlarge ridings nor does it add MPs to Parliament.
* Local PR has an MP in each of our existing ridings.
* Local PR requires each MP to face the voters directly.

Local PR works by grouping 4-7 existing ridings into a region.  Voters in the
region elect the best MPs to represent the region as a whole, but with a 
guarantee that each riding will have one of the region's MPs.

Local PR ballots give voters a lot of flexibility.  They can keep it simple
and vote for just one candidate.  Voters can also rank more than one candidate.

Local PR, as described above, delivers pretty good proportionality (Gallagher
Index < 5 on a wide variety of inputs).  However, to make the proportionality
even better, we envision adding a small number of compensatory ("top-up")
MPs at a later date.
