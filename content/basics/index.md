Local Proportional Representation (Local PR) is an electoral system designed
specifically for Canada.  

* Local PR is proportional.
* Local PR does not enlarge ridings.
* Local PR does not add MPs to Parliament.
* Local PR elects a locally-nominated MP in each of our existing ridings.
* Local PR requires each MP to face the voters directly.

Local PR works by grouping 4-7 existing ridings into a region.  Voters in the
region elect the best MPs to represent the region as a whole, but with a 
guarantee that each riding will have one locally-nominated MP.

Local PR ballots give voters a lot of flexibility.  Ideally, voters will rank
several candidates from the region in order of preference.  However, voters
who prefer to keep it simple can just put an X beside their favourite
candidate.

Local PR, as described above, delivers pretty good proportionality (Gallagher
Index < 5 on a wide variety of scenarios).  However, to make the proportionality
even better, we envision adding a small number of compensatory ("top-up")
MPs at a later date.
