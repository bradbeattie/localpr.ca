# History of Local PR

Local PR grew out of work requested by the Parliamentary Special Committee on 
Electoral Reform (ERRE) and an active group of Guelph (Ontario) citizens.

As it became clear in early January, 2017, that Mr. Trudeau was backing away
from his PR promise, the Guelph group commissioned a poll of 1,500 Guelph households.
Of the 80% that had an opinion on PR, almost 80% said they were concerned about the 
broken promise and wanted some form of PR.

When the group presented this to their local MP, Lloyd Longfield, he said
this was important data that he would present to the House.  But, Mr. Longfield
wanted "an actionable proposal" (e.g. a specific system) to go along with
it.  Furthermore, that system needed to respect existing riding boundaries,
not add any new MPs, and maintain a strong link between electors and the elected.
Mr. Longfield also asked for strong evidence that the broader community, "not just
the usual suspects", supported the system the Guelph group put forward.

The constraints requested by Mr. Longfield were similar to those imposed by
ERRE in their Oct. 20, 2016, request to Byron Weber Becker for models.

After discussion with significant stakeholders all of the major parties and
public consultation, the group decided to put forward a variation of Mr. 
Becker's work for the ERRE.  This model is now known as "Local PR".

The original group of Guelph citizens has expanded and is now known as “Democracy Guelph”. They are gathering Guelph petition signatures to show Mr. Longfield the strong support he wanted to see before advancing Local PR in parliament. 

Other groups like Democracy Guelph (local, multi-party and nonpartisan) are developing in other ridings to provide petition support for their own MPs. Local petition signatures prove to MPs that their local citizens want Local PR for Canada by 2019. 

A new non-profit All Votes Count Canada has been founded to provide communications infrastructure and policy support to all these local campaigns.

As it became clear in early January that Mr. Trudeau was backing away from his PR promise,
a local group of representing citizens from all four major parties requested a meeting January 27th with Liberal MP Lloyd Longfield to show their support for electoral reform, and to ask him to press for a voting system delivering Proportional Representation for Canada by 2019. In advance of the meeting, a poll of the Guelph community was commissioned.  Of the 1,500 households surveyed, 80% had an opinion on PR.  Of those, almost 80% said they were concerned about the broken promise and wanted PR.

When the Guelph group met with Mr. Longfield and presented him with this evidence that the community did in fact want Proportional Representation, he replied that he needed an “actionable proposal”, since there are many PR systems. In other words, he wanted a specific electoral system. Whatever they proposed, he said it needed to respect existing riding boundaries, ensure local MPs were elected, maintain a strong link between the elector and the elected, and not to add more members to the House. (This ruled out the traditional systems of STV (Single Transferable Vote), MMP (Mixed Member Proportional), and even List PR.) 
Longfield further asked the group for strong evidence that the broader community, “not just the usual suspects”, supported whatever actionable system the group was going to put forward.  

The group agreed, and promised they would deliver on both of these requirements so that Mr. Longfield could put an actionable proposal for a new voting system for Canada that makes all votes really count. 

Meanwhile, Byron Weber Becker, a Computer Science faculty member at University of Waterloo, had developed software to model the behaviour of many electoral systems.  He presented this work to the House of Commons Special Committee on Electoral Reform (ERRE) on Oct. 19, 2016. On Oct. 20 the Committee asked him to do some additional work with many
of the same constraints imposed by Mr. Longfield on the Guelph group. Unfortunately, the ERRE didn't have time to consider the results of their request.

Members of the Guelph group discussed the work Byron had done for ERRE and thought that it met Mr. Longfield's requirements.  At a meeting the next day with Frank Valeriote (former Liberal MP), Peter Cameron (longtime NDP member) and Steve Dyck (former Green candidate), it was decided that a variation of this model provided an ideal consensus among them -- and a model that almost everyone else might accept.

Not changing the riding boundaries is a key feature that addresses current political realities. Any system that makes ridings larger results in sitting MPs fighting each other in nomination meetings - which is a non starter.  Also, changing riding boundaries is a difficult task for Elections Canada, and we need a system that can be developed quickly.  Ensuring that the current ridings elected an MP, while creating stronger link to voters preferences is accomplished using a ranked ballot that gathers more information about a voter’s intent across a region.

A few weeks later, David invited the original citizens group and some other key local members of the Liberal, NDP and Green parties to a meeting and proposed they form a civic action group to demonstrate to Mr. Longfield that Guelph is, indeed, behind this proposal. They also laid the foundations for a nationwide push by similar non partisan community-based groups.  They chose to call themselves “Democracy Guelph” and proposed a coalition of groups like themselves across the country, called All Votes Count Canada.  Both Democracy Guelph and All Votes Count Canada are now in energetic motion to advance LPR as a way to make all Canadians votes count.
