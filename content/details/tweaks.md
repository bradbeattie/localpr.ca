Local Proportional Representation isn't a done deal.  There are ideas to consider that might
make it better.  Here's a place to record them.  If you have a suggestion, please
drop [Byron Weber Becker](mailto:info@localpr.ca) a line.

Please remember that we're trying to satisfy many competing interests with Local PR and we
do envision a two-phase implementation.

### Adjustments to Counting

Antony Hodgson, President of *Fair Voting B.C.* wondered if the transfer of surplus
votes was really necessary.  It's the most complicated part of the process and the
easiest to get wrong.

A simulation of the 2015 election without the surplus transfer showed very nearly the
same results in terms of cross-Canada proportionality -- in fact, they were slightly
more proportional.  

More study needs to be done, particularly at the regional level when one popular
candidate receives many more than one quota of votes.
